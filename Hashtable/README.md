Hashtable type of Leet Code

- 217. Contains Duplicate
  Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates. Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.

- 350. Intersection of Two Arrays II
  Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
  Example:
  Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2, 2].

- 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
  Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.
  For example:
  Given binary tree [1,null,2,3],
  1
  \
   2
  /
 3
 return [1,3,2].

- 202. Happy Number
  Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

  A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

  Example: 19 is a happy number

  12 + 92 = 82
  82 + 22 = 68
  62 + 82 = 100
  12 + 02 + 02 = 1
